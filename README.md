# Check HTML Links Github Action test repository

This is the test repository of **[check-html-links-action](https://github.com/jlengrand/check-html-links-action)**.
Check there for documentation and [here](https://github.com/jlengrand/check-html-links-action-test/actions) for latest status. 

**Note: It is NORMAL that one of the workflows is failing. Thats'the point :).**

I'm using [ptemplate](https://github.com/nethruster/ptemplate) to generate a simple website that is valid and test that links are found and correct.
